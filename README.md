# java-serializer
First draft of an experiment to serialize data structures with Java

## Summary
An experiment to see part of what is required to serialize some basic data structures in Java, including primitive types, collections and nested structures. This is for educational use only and should not be used in production. There is no reason to use any part of this project in place of the native serialization mechanisms in Java.
